# Country Mapping
countryCodes.json was generated by calling the dumpCountryCodes() method in index.html, copying the output from the console, and pasting the results into a file. Edits were then made manually as necessary.

# File Naming Conventions
For simplicity, the names of the files containing UN Comtrade data were made equal to the name of the country defined in the map data. The script to retrieve the UN Comtrade data uses the country name defined by the UN so some files were manually adjusted. Specifically:

BosniaHerzegovina.csv to BosniaandHerzegovina.csv
BruneiDarussalam.csv to Brunei.csv
